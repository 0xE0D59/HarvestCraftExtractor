# HarvestCraftExtractor

A small utility plugin for [ExileAPI](https://github.com/TehCheat/ExileApi) to display valid bodies for Raise Spectre spell.

Open your stash where you keep your Horticrafting Stations, press the key and wait for the plugin to count your Harvest crafts and export the results to clipboard.
You can configure which crafts to skip based on their level.

You can also export the crafts to a file using a template. For that there needs to be a CraftListClassification.txt file in plugin directory (contains tags for crafts) and a CraftListTemplate.txt containing the template. The crafts will be exported to the plugin directory.
